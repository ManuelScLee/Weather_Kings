## Name
#WeatherKings: A weather prediction game

## Description
DraftUWeather is a weather prediction game where users forecast daily conditions (temperature, wind, precipitation) and compete for accuracy.
Players earn points based on how close their predictions are to real-world data from APIs such as OpenWeather or NOAA HRRR. The system will compare user predictions to actual data and generate a score which can be posted on a global leaderboard. Additional features could be a 'Forecast of the day' or 'WildCard Weather Guess' where users guess on certain weather conditions occuring. 

## Project Architecture  
Our system will use **three Docker containers** to create a full-stack application.

### Components  
- **Frontend**: React Native  
  - Displays the UI for entering predictions and viewing results  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot  
  - Handles REST API logic, scoring, and data requests  
- **Database**: MySQL  
  - Stores users, predictions, scores, and weather data  

### Data Flow  
React Native (Frontend) → Spring Boot (Backend) → MySQL (Database)  
The backend will also connect to external APIs (OpenWeather, NOAA HRRR) to fetch real weather data for scoring.

## Project Specifications  

**Core Features**  
- Submit daily predictions for weather metrics  
- Fetch real data from public weather APIs  
- Calculate and display scores based on prediction accuracy  
- Maintain a leaderboard of user performance  

**Additional Features (Planned)**  
- Forecast of the Day challenge  
- Wildcard Weather Guess mode  
- Graphs or trends showing user accuracy over time  

**Technical Goals**  
- Containerized deployment using Docker Compose  
- RESTful communication between frontend and backend  
- Persistent storage of users and predictions  

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. At this moment - N/A

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method. At this moment - N/A

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. At this moment - N/A

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. At this moment - N/A

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc. Piazza or Email TAs/Professor

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser. At this moment - N/A

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
